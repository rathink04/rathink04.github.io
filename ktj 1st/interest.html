						<p>
							It seems I have a never ending passion for these two!
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							When it comes to music, from Western Hip-Hop to Indian Classical, I love them all.
							Sometimes I myself feel amazed by the variety of genre of songs I prefer listening to, ranging from Eminem's Rap to AR Rahman's soulful songs.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							I know you might feel its little childish for a collage student to read comics but I think its ok to embrace the child in you from time to time.
							Following every news, wiki-page, anime and movies related to comics characters is my favorite passtime. Nerd and Proud.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							Recently my interest in music has tempted me in learning guitar. Though I am taking the lessons casually but hey, you never know what future has in store for me. :P
